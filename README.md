These scores are mainly from NBA teams such as the Indiana Pacers and Orlando Magic.  This data shows the significant scores around the playoffs in the 2013-2014 NBA season.  This data was not necessarily the best to tell a story with, but it did contain actual data from that season.

Top Billboard Artists (1900-2000s)
(http://tsort.info/music/chart_song_usbullfrog.htm)
This data shows the top billboard artists throughout the 1900s all the way up to the 2000s.  The data includes a few one-hit-wonders as well as known and the top artists in music.  The years of the releases of songs were included in the data as well, which makes this info more timely.  Again, this info does not necessarily tell a story, but the data shows people who the top artists of certain time periods were.
